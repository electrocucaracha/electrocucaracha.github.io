I’m a self-learner, avid reader and passionate person. As a leader, I
help teams during all the software development phases from gathering
requirements to deployment. I focus on planning, designing and
delivering high impact solutions to emerging issues using best of breed
tools. I have proven success in managing and delivering on time
different projects. As a Cloud Software Engineer, I’m interested on
architecting automated and distributed software solutions that are easy
to use, scale and adapt. I’m a fervent supporter of the DevOps culture,
lastly motivated for Software Defined Networking(SDN) technologies.
